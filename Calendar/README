A simple Calendar project. A Calendar object can keep track of one-time events and events that repeat weekly.
Instead of the DynamicArray implementation we used in class, the Calendar project uses the built-in class vector, which essentially supports the same operations.

Covered topics:
+ memory management
+ operator overloading
+ friend functions
+ const correctness
+ inheritance, method overriding
+ virtual methods / polymorphism
+ virtual destructors
